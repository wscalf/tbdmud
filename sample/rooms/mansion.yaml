name: Grand Foyer
desc: >
  The entryway to the mansion with a central grand staircase white treads and a red runner, all faded now, and the runner rotting and crumbling. There's a fountain in the middle of the room that hasn't run in a long time, and is dry with traces of algae. A round plate glass window above the doorway lets the light in from outside.

    desc: An older man dressed in rough, worn clothes with a wide variety of utilities, but mismatched and old. This fellow isn't a sanctioned explorer and may just be some kind of treasure hunter. He seems friendly enough on the surface but doesn't seem trusting. He's currently also searching the storeroom.
